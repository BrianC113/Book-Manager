# Book-Manager
## Student Management System

This is a simple Python-based system for library books that I built during my first semester at university. It allows users to browse through existing books and organize them in a user-friendly way.


## Features
- View pre-existing books
- Add new books
- Remove/Edit books

## Technologies
- Python 3.13.1 (IDLE Shell)
- Notepad++ for editing  

## What I learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python concepts, including 
- File handling 
- Data storage
- Conditional logic and loops


## Future improvements
- Add a graphical user interface(GUI)
- Add a user login system with stronger validation and error handling
- Enhance book management by allowing easier editing, searching, and categorizing of meals
- Refine the weekly plan feature to allow custom preferences or dietary restrictions
